__core__ is a concept introduced by Nicholas C. Zakas in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pFv9NB9fs)

It helps you create scalable applications written in Javascript, giving you some structure and patterns to keep everything separated.



## The Idea

Conceptually, everything in your application is a module, and your modules should work independently from each other, so if one module breaks, the others should not.

The central piece is the core.

A module should never talks directly to another module, for that you use a combination of listeners and notifications.

## Getting Started

So let's think about the twitter page, and how we could re-build it using the __core__ concept

![Twitter Modules](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2321259/5558085/3caa2e2c-8d00-11e4-8eba-4613b593193f.png)

Everything inside a red square is a module, they work in a way that they don't depend on any other modules, and they should be programmed that way as well.


## Installing


`npm i @eroc/core`


## Import

Raw import

`import { Core, ALL, ERROR } from "./node_modules/@eroc/core/dist/core.js";`

With rollup, webpack or parcel

`import { Core, ALL, ERROR } from "@eroc/core";`

NodeJs or Browserify

`const { Core, ALL, ERROR } = require("@eroc/core");`

Let's start with the tweet module.

### Building modules

A module exports start and optionally a stop function.

```js
export { start, stop };


const start = function (emitter) {
  return {};
};

const stop = function (instance) {
  // instance is what start returned
  // this allows to close open files, sockets, etc
};
```

To start this module in your core file:

```js
import { Core } from "@eroc/core";
import * as exampleModule from "./exampleModule.js";

const core = new Core();
core.start(exampleModule);
```

Modules can only communicate via messages with other modules with the emitter received when start is called. It garantees that if a module tries to call something that doesn't exists or is broken, it won't break the module itself.

```js
emitter.on(EVENT_NAME, function (data) {

});

emitter.emit(EVENT_NAME, { a: 7 });
```

To avoid spelling mistakes, import event names from a common file called eventNames.js.


### Destroying modules

You might want to stop a module in some point, this can be easily done using the method `core.stop()`.

```js
const exampleId = core.start(exampleModule);
core.stop(exampleId);
```

When you stop a module, the function `stop` will be called, if it exists.

### Comunicating between modules

Now, thinking about Twitter, everytime you tweet something, it should appear on your tweet list right? but since our modules don't talk directly to each other, let's use the emitter.

First of all, our `tweet` module should notify other modules that something has happened.

```js
export { start };

const start = function(emitter) {
  // For the sake of simplicity, use an interval
  setInterval(function() {
    emitter.emit(NEW_TWEET,  {
      author: 'Mauricio Soares',
      text: 'core is pretty #cool'
    });
  }, 5 * 1000)
};
```

Every 5 seconds, this module notifies everything that is listening to `NEW_TWEET` that something has happened. If nothing is listening to it, then nothing happens.

Our `tweet-list` is going to listen for this notifications.

```js
export { start };

const start = function (emitter) {
  emitter.on(NEW_TWEET, (data) => {
      // do something with the data
  });
};
```

Cool right? If one of those modules stop working, than it won't break the other one!



## Docs

#### core.start(module, options)

 * `module`  The module as a name-space (import * as exampleModule from "./exampleModule.js")
 * `options` optional object
   * name optional, String or Symbol that become *moduleInstanceId*

returns a promise that resolves with *moduleInstanceId* that can later be used to stop the module


```js
const exampleInstanceId = await Core.start(exampleModule);
```


#### core.stop(moduleInstanceId)

```js
await core.stop(exampleInstanceId);
```

#### ALL

Constant to listen to all events

```js
// listen for all events
core.on(ALL, ({ name, data, time }) => {
    const timeString = new Date(time).toISOString();
    console.debug(`${timeString} event ${String(name)} with data`, data);
});
```

#### ERROR

Constant to listen to most errors

```js
// listen for errors
core.on(ERROR, ({ time, phase, error }) => {
    const timeString = new Date(time).toISOString();
    console.error(`Error during phase ${phase} at ${timeString}`, error);
});
```
